# Introduction to Antobyte
My goal is to do my part to create a better internet. I will utilize the tools I have to combat the forces which I do not like and I believe are bad for the world.

Products and Services:
- Antobyte Web (Brave Goggle). A goggle for the brave web browser which acts like a "Gatekeeper" for the internet. I will work hard and constantly add more sites to the list. I am aiming to help people avoid AI generated garbage websites, ad farm sites, and affiliate websites. I want anyone to be able to search for a service and have a trusted site show up or search for answers and have a trusted authority delivered to them on the results.

Future Products:
These are projects I want to make but have not started yet
- Sync for calendar, contacts, and notes (without needing an everything account such as google and also without anyone looking at your data)
